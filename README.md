# Welcome to pquill

pquill(personal quill) is a blog compiler I made myself based on markdown syntax. It does not actually support commonmark, it was more the syntax of commonmark that I liked. 

Everything here is hand made, from the lexer down to the render. Its far from perfect, and that is to be expected. Its a project that doesn't get a large amount of love, its purely here to write a html page that has one style.

## Why not just use something already made, or use libraries?

I like the experimentation. Its almost like I wouldn't learn as much by using `import html_from_markdown` and doing this in 2 lines. To extend that and make it harder on myself I decided not to use **Parser Generators** or really any other library that might help me accomplish this. 

## Who is this intended for?

As selfish as it sounds. It was made purely for myself- however it is also indended for anyone that wants to hack on this. Its a toy, and something I write blogs with. Ugly, Yet Beautiful blogs. 

## So.. What does it look like

It looks like my [LWN](https://lwn.net) custom css profile. I read a lot of LWN and like the blog style, oldschool yellow coffee stain pages.
