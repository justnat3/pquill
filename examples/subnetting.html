I also think that subnetting is useful for saving part of your address space by being able to use more of it.</p><p>The Private Address Space is defined in RFC1918 </p><h2> So how do I do it?</h2><h4> 1. Understanding IP(v4)</h4><p>Out in the wild you will see two things, the address and a mask for that address</p><p>The address isn't entirely special in this case, as long as it conforms to RFC1918. The mask however means quite a lot to how an address is understood by a network, its really the bread and butter of our subnetting.</p><p>Understanding the parts of our mask we have to understand what parts of the mask actually means in subnetting. This is simple, within a byte you may have (ordered) a 1 or a 0. The leading 1's are the NETWORK portion of the mask. The 0's are the HOST portion of the mask.</p><p>Lets say you need 10 sub networks with (172.16.5.0/16)</p><p>how do we break that one network owned by one router (x.x.5.x) into 10</p><ol><li value='1'>First take e</li></ol><div class='code_block'><pre>
